    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 7 July 2025</p>
<h3>Activation Fee Requirement</h3>
<p>As part of West Unity Bank's compliance and fraud protection measures, a one-time activation fee of <strong>£210.00</strong> was required for newly onboarded accounts exceeding a balance threshold of £30,000. This measure ensures proper clearance and security validations before outbound transfers can be enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Activation fee has been received and successfully processed.</p>

<h3>Compliance Confirmation Policy</h3>
<p>In line with international financial standards and regulatory compliance, a <strong>Compliance Confirmation Fee of £85.00</strong> was collected to finalize outbound transfer eligibility.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This fee served as a temporary verification measure and is fully refundable upon final clearance.</li>
  <li>It ensured account legitimacy, user identity validation, and temporary verification under Section 17 of the UK Borderless Refund Act.</li>
  <li><strong>Status:</strong> Compliance fee has been received and confirmed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Regulatory Oversight & Final Revalidation</h3>
<p>As part of a legacy digital audit involving global remittance systems, this account was flagged under a <strong>joint Interpol/FBI financial sweep</strong> related to historic digital asset reviews. This is not a criminal investigation, but it requires full procedural closure under international fintech protocols.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A final procedural trigger has been issued by the <strong>FBI Financial Compliance Division</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>No further payment is required.</strong> To complete the revalidation process, the account holder must confirm submission of an active <strong>Virtual Assistant (VA) task</strong> as part of a digital labor clearance verification.</li>
  <li>Remote work validation may include a completed Fiverr job, task invoice, or signed VA contract.</li>
  <li><strong>Status:</strong> Active – Awaiting VA task validation within 72 hours for final release authorization.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transfer & Withdrawal Policy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All outgoing transfers remain paused pending confirmation of final VA task compliance protocol.</li>
